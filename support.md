## FAQ

### My server provider only support PHP based applications, is that ok?

No. Plus, if you run one of those archaic things, it's time for you to upgrade to an actual server.

### What happens to my credentials? 

Credentials are stored client's side using a http only cookie that's encrypted and authenticated. Unless you use the share feature for which Filestash is forced to store an encrypted version of your credentials, nothing is kept server side.

### Why don't you support ubuntu, debian, centos, rhel, fedora, arch, ... ?

There's support for many linux distribution but those installers are only provided to my patreons. For everyone else, you can use docker to install Filestash.
