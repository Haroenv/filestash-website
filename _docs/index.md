## Why Filestash?

Filestash (formerly Nuage) started as its [author](https://mickael-kerjean.me) couldn't find an acceptable file sharing service that:
1. Only focus on solving the problem "Managing your data in a cloud you control" and do it well
2. Doesn't try to own your data but let you sit on the shoulders of giant (eg: many FTP and SFTP servers that's been battles tested for decades, PAM for authentication, the access right of a linux server)
3. has a user interface that doesn't feel like a second class citizen compared to Dropbox or Google Drive
4. is fast and not bloated whilst being open source

Filestash is an attempt to fix those pain points. We don't pretend to have succeed yet but it's getting there slowly but surely
