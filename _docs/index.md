When all your documents are spread over many different places, vendors and clouds, Filestash is the solution to unify all your data into one single web application (S3, FTP, SFTP, Webdav, Minio, Dropbox and Google drive)

To install Filestash, you can either:
- Install the application on your own server: [see the documentation](/docs/install-and-upgrade).
- Let us do it on your behalf so you don't have to worry about anything: [see our packs](/pricing)
