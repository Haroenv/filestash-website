1. Clicking on the edit icon lets you **move a file** either with an absolute path or relative. In other word, you can type:
  - `/tmp/foo.txt` to move in your tmp folder and rename your file to foo.txt
  - `../test/bar.txt`
2. Ctrl+F to **search** for something
3. Alt+1, Alt+2: to change the **view mode** while browsing your files
4. Ctrl+h: to toggle visibility of **hidden files**
5. Esc to exit visible popup
6. Navigating to [/about](http://demo.filestash.app/about) gives you information about the release and associated plugins that are in use
7. The text editor supports many of the **keybindings** from emacs. If you're not part of the [church of emacs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAnWjQQufgs&t=22), we also provide keybindings for vi and sublime. This can be set via the admin console
