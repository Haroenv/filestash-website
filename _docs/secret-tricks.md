In addition to the configuration, Filestash contains a range of shortcuts and not so secret secrets.

1. Clicking on the edit icon lets you move a file either with an absolute path or relative. In other word, you can type: 
  1. `/tmp/foo.txt` to move in your tmp folder and rename your file to test.txt
  2. `../test/bar.txt` 
2. Ctrl+F to search for something
3. Alt+1, Alt+2: to change the view mode
4. Ctrl+h: to toggle visibility of hidden files
5. Esc to remove something in your way
6. Navigating to [`/about`](http://demo.filestash.app/about) gives you information about the release and associated plugins
7. The text editor supports many of the keybindings from emacs. If you're not a saint, we also provide keybindings for vi and sublime via [the config](/docs/configuration#editor-keybinding)
